            <p>
              I'm Yazedy Yahya, a Michigan State University graduate from
              Holland, Michigan, with a Bachelor of Arts in Experience
              Architecture. I specialize in user experience design and writing,
              creating interfaces and content that are clear and effective for
              users. My focus is on designing systems that function well and
              crafting text that communicates directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm good at taking complicated ideas and making them clear,
              whether that's through a clean UX layout or a sharp piece of
              writing. I read a lot, which keeps me thinking and feeds into what
              I do. When I'm not working, I'm usually out hiking, flipping
              through a book, or messing around with a sketch. I like projects
              that need both careful thought and a bit of creativity, and I'm
              prepared to contribute my expertise to meaningful work.
